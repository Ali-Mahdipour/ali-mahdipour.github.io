## Academic Projects

My academic projects involve experimental and applied research in consumer neuroscience and behavioral science.

### Areas of Work
- Eye-tracking studies on attention, information processing, and visual design
- EEG-based analysis of consumer responses and perceived value
- Multimodal data integration (behavioral, neural, self-report)
- Experimental design for decision-making research

These projects have contributed to peer-reviewed publications, conference posters, and graduate-level theses.
