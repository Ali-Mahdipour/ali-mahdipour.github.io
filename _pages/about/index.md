## Background & CV

This section provides an overview of my **professional** and **academic** background, as well as access to relevant CVs.

### Sections
- [Professional background](/about/professional/)
- [Academic background](/about/academic/)

The two tracks reflect different but related aspects of my work:
- applied research and industry experience, and
- academic research, teaching, and publications.
