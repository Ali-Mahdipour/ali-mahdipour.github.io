# Daily Note | 2026-02-08

**11:22 AM**  
Today, I woke up at approximately 8:30 a.m., which was about one hour later than my usual schedule. The night before, I went to bed late after playing badminton with my wife at a nearby park. In addition, she prepared a salad for my lunch, which took another thirty minutes. As a result, we did not fall asleep until around 1:30 a.m., nearly an hour later than normal.

Because I needed to arrive at the office by 10:30 a.m., I did not study GRE vocabulary this morning. I accepted a Snapp*!* cab ride from Gisha to Velenjak and then headed directly to work. Fortunately, I was able to use the office parking facility and did not have to spend additional time searching for a parking spot.

Today is expected to be a busy day, as I plan to send out routine surveys to our bikers and van drivers after a long interval. To accomplish this, I need to make several adjustments to the Python code I use to sample survey participants from our databases and decrypt recipients’ contact information. In order to improve usability and maintainability, I plan to create a separate module that handles the decryption process.

**18:27**  
I can now describe today as a bad day so far. The only two tasks I managed to accomplish were revising my survey-sampling Python code and attending a meeting with the commercial VP, to whom my direct manager reports. For the first task, I merged two separate scripts that were used for different surveys and created modular code that I can reuse in other projects. Specifically, one of the functions I wrote establishes a connection to our database, while another combines several functions used to decrypt contact information.

Before I finish work for the day, I still need to complete two additional tasks. I have to update a dataset used in strategic analyses, and I also need to fix some minor issues in the IX weekly report (the project and report titles have been changed for confidentiality).

Today is also my wedding anniversary, and I plan to buy a gift and some flowers for my wife. I guess I will not be able to study vocabulary today.
