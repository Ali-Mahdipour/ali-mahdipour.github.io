# Daily Note | 2026-02-10

**11:45**  
Today I woke up at about 7:15 and after taking Zohreh to her work place I studied some vocabulary and accepted some Snapp! cab rides then headed to the office. Again, I didn't find a parking spot near the office, where I could easily walk, so I parked about three streets away and took a cab ride. Before arriving at the office I received a phone call from the courier who had taken my Snapp Shop order to the office and I asked him to put it in the designated box in the office for such orders. This was my ping pong rackets and balls that I ordered a few days ago and I hope we can use them tonight.

Last night I played some badminton with my wife and sister-in-law in a park near our house and it was enjoyable. Tonight we can play ping pong too.
