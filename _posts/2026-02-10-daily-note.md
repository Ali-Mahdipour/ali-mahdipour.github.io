# Daily Note | 2026-02-10

**11:45**  
Today I woke up at about 7:15 and after taking Zohreh to her work place I studied some vocabulary and accepted some Snapp! cab rides then headed to the office. Again, I didn't find a parking spot near the office, where I could easily walk, so I parked about three streets away and took a cab ride. Before arriving at the office I received a phone call from the courier who had taken my Snapp Shop order to the office and I asked him to put it in the designated box in the office for such orders. This was my ping pong rackets and balls that I ordered a few days ago and I hope we can use them tonight.

Last night I played some badminton with my wife and sister-in-law in a park near our house and it was enjoyable. Tonight we can play ping pong too.

Here are the tasks I have planned to accomplish today:  
- Having a meeting with the Ops managers on the IX weekly report
- Revising the Box and Van weekly surveys according to the spotted new requirments
- Revising the basic analysis code and sampling queries for these surveys
- Double checking the new versions of the IX surveys and being ready for release in the up comming week
- Revising the IX analysis codes based on the test responses and being ready for updating reports on the comming Saturday
- Submiting a test order on the DFF service `:white_check_mark:`  `\u274c`  \u274c \u2705
