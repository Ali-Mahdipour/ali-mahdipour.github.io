# Daily Note | 2026-02-18

**11:33**  
Today I got up about 7:00 and we managed to arrive early at Zohreh's work place which is rare! Then I worked with car for some time and studied like 150 GRE vocabulary, which I will try to post here those I had forgotten. I hope today I will have a more productive day. So far, I have studied more vocabulary than previous days which gives me a sense of satisfaction. Aiming at increasing my productivity at work I have decided to have deep focus time blocks in which I do not take a break from my task at hand. Now is the planning time which I should finish by 12:00. Then I will be posting my forgotten words of the day by 12:15 before proceeding with the next task. Also, along with the to do list I will note the start time and ETA for each of the tasks to keep track of how long each one of them was estimated to take and actually took. I also will sort the tasks by their priority. I also will push the changes each time I recode them before proceeding with the next task.

Here are the list of the tasks I have planned to accomplish today:



- [ ] Writing a query on company's databases for getting the target details of the VO project in CID 3 to 5 (s: 12:15, eta: 45 min, s2f: ??)
- [ ] Getting affirmation of a data owner on the results of my query (s: 13:00, eta: 45 min, s2f: ??)
