# Daily Note | 2026-02-15

**10:36**  
Today I got up about 7:15 and after taking Zohreh to her work place I accepted two cab rides and earned about 500 KT. In the meantime and after that I also studied about 55 cards on Anki. I parked my car about two streets away and took a Snapp! bike ride to the office and arrived at 10:30.

Last night I Zohreh and her sister played ping pong in the Park beside Azadi square and had some tea from about 11:30 to 00:40 which was fun. After arriving home we ate some fruit before going to bed and we ended up sleeping after 1:30. Last night I also had a look at the books I had ordered online and read a few pages of one of them. I posted the cover of this one on the photos section of today's notes.
