# Daily Note | 2026-02-05

This is my **first daily note** on my personal website.  
I’ll try to post other notes from time to time and capture small moments, thoughts, and progress along the way.

Today was a calm and enjoyable weekend day.

I slept more than I usually do, and after having a fine and delicious breakfast with my wife, we spent some time together. I also helped a little with preparing lunch. Later in the day, I headed out and worked as a Snapp Cab driver for a while. In between rides, I studied some GRE vocabulary, which felt surprisingly productive.

After that, I went to **V Cafe in Gholhak**, where I spent more time studying GRE vocabulary and also worked on my personal website. I updated the *Professional Background* page and added a link to my updated professional CV.

I hope I can study a bit more GRE vocabulary before heading back home.

I really enjoyed today, and I hope we can go out tonight and play some badminton after dinner in a nearby park we recently discovered.

Finally, I want to note that I have restarted—more seriously this time—considering applying for a PhD next year. I’m trying to take small but consistent steps toward that goal.
