# Daily Note | 2026-02-17

**17:52**  
Today I got up about 7:00 and we managed to arrive early at Zohreh's work place which is rare! Then I worked with car for some time and studied like 50 GRE vocabulary, which I will try to post here those I had forgotten. Things didn't go well with my work. There are whole a lot of news that directly affect our life in Iran. Negotiations of our damn goverment with the US and the news around an imminent US-Israel strike. 

I need to work on the important project IX Data but the OV data gathering project is more pressing and I have to handle this first yet its priority and importance is low overall. So I'm going to fix the python code for automated data download and update for the CID 4 and make a new survey for the CID 3. I hope I can get the target data for these from the Ops team in the meantime. Furthermore the VQA and CSQA reports are not required to be prepared for this week, but I should make sure their codes works well so that next week we can have their reports till Sunday. 

Here are the list of the tasks I have planned to accomplish today:



- [ ] Revising the basic analysis code and sampling queries for routine surveys
- [ ] Adding research ID to the sampling code of the surveys
- [ ] Getting access to Minio for sharing data
- [ ] Requesting creation of a Minio bucket for MR team
- [ ] Having a meeting with the Ops managers on the IX weekly report
- [ ] Targeting more bikers in CID 3, 4, and 5 for VO project
- [x] Preparing the downloader code for VO project surveys for CID 4
- [x] Revising the IX analysis codes based on the test responses and being ready for updating reports on the comming Saturday
- [x] Checking the capacity for the VO project and updating my local and cloud data base for this project
- [ ] ~~Preparing VQA weekly report~~
- [ ] ~~Preparing CSQA weekly report~~


Personal tasks I have planned for today:

- [ ] Practising ping pong for at least 30min
- [ ] Studying at least 1 CT, 1 SE, and 1 RC GRE question
- [ ] Calling my mom
- [ ] Calling Zohreh
- [ ] ~~Buying a gold necklace pendant for Zohreh~~
- [x] Posting the forgotten words of the day in this page
