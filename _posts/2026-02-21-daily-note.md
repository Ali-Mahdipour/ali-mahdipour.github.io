# Daily Note | 2026-02-21

**12:48**  
Today I got up a bit late. It was about 7:30 that I woke up and we arrived late at Zohreh's work place. I earned like 300 KT working with car and studied like 150 GRE vocabulary before heading to the office. I arrived at the office about 10:45. Over the weekend I studied a good deal of vocabulary and earned some money working with car but spent much more buying clothes for Zohreh and grocery items in case there occures any war soon. I have to buy a rechargable light source too in cases we have any electricity outages. 
I didn't manage to post daily notes during the weekend and the list of the forgotten vocabulary that I have studied since Wednsday is going to be longer than usual, but I will try to post them in this page.
