# Daily Note | 2026-02-16

**10:47**  
Today I got up about 7:15 and after taking Zohreh to her work place I studied like 60 GRE vocabulary and accepted couple of cab rides before heading to the office. After finding a parking spot relatively farther from the office I took a cab ride to the office. Last night I visited Opal shopping center to see if I can buy an affordable necklace pendant for Zohreh and I couldn't. Then after arriving at home Zohreh took my dinner and we headed to the part where we played some ping pong. I slept well at night and feel better today.
