# Daily Note | 2026-02-09

**15:45**  
Today I woke up at about 7:30 AM and after taking my wife to her work place studied some GRE vocabulary and accepted a few Snapp! cab requests before arriving at the office. I couldn't find a parking spot near office and parked the car two streets away and took a bike to the office. And about yesterday, almost everything went well, and I bought some cake and some flowers for our wedding anniversary and had a small celebration with my wife. Furthermore, the work went well yesterday except for one task that remained unattended. 

Today I prepared the file for the routine surveys in the new format as required by the new team owning the communications. Now I am waiting for the go ahead from my manager for sending them out. At work I saw Mohammad Javad who recently have resigned and we missed him since then. Today, I have studied 50 vocabulary cards so far, 28 of which I had to relearn and I will write these down here.

Forgotten cards of today so far:  
• brooch
• obtuse
• spectacle
• whisk
• hallow
• limber
• guild
• ferment
• spurn
• odium
• annus horribilis
• verve
• gestate
• terry
• wont
• perspicuity
• sidereal
• voyeur
• exodus
• coterie
• gambol
• flaky
• purport
• tenant
• calligraphy
• levee
• nascent
• throes

**17:15**  
Now I am going to work on the task left from yesterday which is finalization of weekly report of IX project data. I hope I will finish this by 18:15 and start working on my next task.
