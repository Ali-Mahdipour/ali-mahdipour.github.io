# Daily Note | 2026-02-07

**10:45 AM**  
It's saturday and I'm starting my day and new week hoping this is going to be a great week. The last one was a complicated one and I can't call it all good. I had some procrastinations at work and didn't manage to get some of my most important tasks done. I am working on making some adjustments to one of the strategic reports on our competitors' key performance metrics. There are multiple areas in which this report should be improved as well as multiple calculation errors. I use live questionpro data stored on a cloud service to get the raw data from multiple surveys which I aggregate for the sake of the calculations done in this report. I use python for reading and cleaning this data and storing back the cleaned version in an other cloud data base. Then again an other python code of mine reads the cleaned data for each competitor and does some aggregations and calculations and some more report specific cleaning then puts the data in an other cloud data base. A MS Excel report is connected to this final data base through power query and the final visualization of the results are done in Excel. One of the python codes I have written for this project is about 2000 lines long and the other is about 1500 lines which makes debuging it burdensome. Because the first code is used in multiple other strategic projects making adjustments to it might make things go wrong in more unexpected ways so I have to make most of the changes to the second and final analysis pipline. 

**11:00 AM**  
Today I woke up at about 7:30 and after taking my wife to her work place I studies some GRE vocab while I was in car and did a few Snapp Cab rides and studied some more vocab after that before arriving at the office. after writing some daily notes I want to resume working on my report. Starting from the recent uprising in Iran and shut down of the interner we halted sending out surveys to our users. Now I should see if we are going to send weekly surveys which we used to send on Saturdays. I also plan to put the list of the GRE vocabulary I studied on Anki in my daily note and see if I can keep doing this in the comming days.

**12:00**  
I updated one of the key reports, NOX (used an alt name for the sake of confidentiality), this actually updates 7 data bases which various reports are connected to. My initial observation suggest this was done correctly. Then I updated the second data base and I need to check the result in the final report to see if anything has gone wrong. I need to check out the MoM of the last meeting I had with my manager, Farzad, to make sure my final report fully meets all the requirments. I will have a short coffee break before that. 

**16:00**  
I made some satisfactory progress towards my accomplishing the important task of mine this should be done by the end of today. I plan to work with cab for some short time after work and study more GRE vocabulary. I will post the words I studied today here. I have like half an hour left for Anki studies and then I should take some real tests on verbal and quant sections as well as a brief writing practice which should not last longer than an other 1 hour.

**19:53**  
I finally finished the report I was working on. I will need to make further improvements on this report and make an other daily report in paralel to this weekly report. I will be working on these tomorrow.
