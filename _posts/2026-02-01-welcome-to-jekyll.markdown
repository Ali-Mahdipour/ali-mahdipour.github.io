This website serves as a personal and professional space to document my work at the intersection of **market research**, **consumer behavior**, and **consumer neuroscience**.

The content here reflects both:
- applied research conducted in commercial settings, and  
- academic work focused on decision-making, perception, and behavior.

### Purpose of the Site
The site is intended to:
- provide a concise overview of my professional and academic background,
- summarize selected projects and research areas,
- host short articles and notes on market research practice, neuromarketing methods, and applied data analysis.

This is not a blog in the traditional sense. Articles published here are exploratory, reflective, or explanatory in nature, and are written for a general professional audience.

### Scope and Boundaries
Some projects and experiences are discussed at a high level.  
Specific datasets, internal processes, and client information are intentionally excluded due to confidentiality considerations.

Future posts may cover topics such as:
- research design in real-world environments,
- combining behavioral and psychophysiological data,
- pricing and consumer perception,
- methodological reflections from applied research.

Content will be added gradually and selectively.
